# Open-source Project
Generated payloads for Android, Linux and Windows and exploited windows machine using Metasploit framework.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to generate payloads for three different platforms (Android, Linux and Windows) and use the Metasploit framework to exploit a Windows machine. The project emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in computer systems to enhance their security and prevent unauthorized access. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities of the Metasploit framework and how it can be used to perform various attacks on vulnerable systems.

# Description
The project of generating payloads for three different platforms (Android, Linux and Windows) and exploiting a Windows machine using the Metasploit framework involves creating payloads that can be used to gain access to vulnerable systems and executing them using the Metasploit framework. The objective of this project is to demonstrate how the Metasploit framework can be used to perform penetration testing and ethical hacking on various platforms.

# Scope
This repository is intended for use by web application security professionals and pentesters. It contains a collection of payloads and bypasses that can be used during web application security assessments to identify vulnerabilities.

# Usage
To use this repository, you can either download the entire repository or use individual files. The payloads are categorized into different directories based on their usage, such as XSS, SQLi, LFI/RFI, etc. Simply navigate to the appropriate directory and select the payload you want to use. Each file contains a detailed description of the payload and how it can be used.
